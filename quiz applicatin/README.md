# QUIZ APPLICATION
The Java Quiz Application is an interactive multiple-choice quiz designed to test users' knowledge of Java fundamentals. The application features a timer, randomized questions, and displays the final results at the end of the quiz. 

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio Code**: If you havenâ€™t installed VS Code, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Java Extension Pack for VS Code**: Install the Java Extension Pack by Microsoft for optimal support when working with Java in VS Code.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Installing the Java Extension Pack
