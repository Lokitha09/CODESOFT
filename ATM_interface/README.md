# ATM INTERFACE
This ATM Machine project is a simple Java application that simulates basic banking operations. Users can check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw funds using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK**: Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. [Download JDK here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **Visual Studio Code**: If you havenâ€™t installed VS Code, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Java Extension Pack for VS Code**: Install the Java Extension Pack by Microsoft for optimal support when working with Java in VS Code.

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Installing the Java Extension Pack

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to **Extensions** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for **Java Extension Pack** by Microsoft.
4. Click **Install**.

The Java Extension Pack includes essential tools for working with Java in VS Code, such as project management, debugging, and Maven/Gradle support.
